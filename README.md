# Walmart Leasing Space Checker

This script automates the process of finding suitable retail spaces available at Walmart locations based on specific criteria.

## üîç What It Does

1. **Scrapes Walmart Leasing Page**: Extracts information about all available properties.
2. **Applies Filters**:
   - Spaces under 1000 sqft
   - Locations with more than 10,000 Google reviews
   - No mobile phone repair stores present
3. **Sends Email Notifications**: When matching properties are found.
4. **Runs on a Schedule**: Can be configured to check daily.

## ‚ú® Features
